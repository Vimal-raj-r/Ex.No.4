### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

## 🧩 Idea Generation Prompts
**Prompt:** *“What strategies can self-driving cars adopt to safely navigate crowded intersections?”*  

**Generated Ideas:**  
- 🚗 **V2X Communication:** Cars communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians’ devices, and traffic signals.  
- 👀 **Advanced Sensor Fusion:** Combine LiDAR, radar, and camera inputs for accurate real-time perception.  
- ⏱ **Dynamic Risk Assessment:** Continuously calculate probabilities of collisions and adjust routes.  
- 🔄 **Priority Rules Engine:** Give emergency vehicles and pedestrians higher priority.  
- ☁️ **Cloud-Based Learning:** Share intersection experiences across fleets to improve safety algorithms.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Persona & Context Prompts
**Prompt:** *“What should the car’s system communicate to passengers and pedestrians for trust and clarity?”*  

**Generated Context:**  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **For Passengers:**  
  - Display real-time decisions (“Waiting for pedestrian to cross”, “Yielding to emergency vehicle”).  
  - Provide reassurance with safety-first messages.  

- 🚶 **For Pedestrians & Other Drivers:**  
  - Clear **visual signals** (lights/LED strips on the car body).  
  - **Audible alerts** when yielding or proceeding.  
  - Transparent communication to build trust in AV behavior.
